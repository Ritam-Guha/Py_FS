Description: # Py_FS: A Python Package for Feature Selection
        Py_FS is a toolbox developed with complete focus on Feature Selection (FS) using Python as the underlying programming language. It comes with capabilities like nature-inspired evolutionary feature selection algorithms, filter methods and simple evaulation metrics to help with easy applications and comparisons among different feature selection algorithms over different datasets. It is still in the development phase. We wish to extend this package further to contain more extensive set of feature selection procedures and corresponding utilities.

        For example, if someone wants to use GA, it should be imported using the following statement:
        
            import Py_FS.wrapper.nature_inspired.GA
        
        There are mainly three utilities in the current version of the package. The next part discusses these
        three parts in detail:
        
        ## Quick User Guide
        For a quicl demonstration of the process of using Py_FS, please proceed to this Colab link: [Py_FS: Demonstration](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PafNTmVgWv9Qz6j7bI41XqPT6CCCIb1T?usp=sharing).
        
        ## 1. Wrapper-based Nature-inpsired Feature Selection
        Wrapper-based Nature-inspired methods are very popular feature selection approaches due to their efficiency and simplicity. These methods progress by introducing random set of candidate solutions (agents which are natural elements like particles, whales, bats etc.) and improving these solutions gradually by using guidance mechanisms of fitter agents. In order to calculate the fitness of the candidate solutions, wrappers require some learning algorithm (like classifiers) to calculate the worth of a solution at every iteration. This makes wrapper methods extremely reliable but computationally expensive as well.
        
        Py_FS currently supports the following 12 wrapper-based FS methods:
        * Binary Bat Algorithm (BBA)
        * Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CS)
        * Equilibrium Optimizer (EO)
        * Genetic Algorithm (GA)
        * Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA)
        * Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO)
        * Harmony Search (HS)
        * Mayfly Algorithm (MA)
        * Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
        * Red Deer Algorithm (RDA)
        * Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA)
        * Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA)
        
        These wrapper approaches can be imported in your code using the following statements:
            
            import Py_FS.wrapper.nature_inspired.BBA
            import Py_FS.wrapper.nature_inspired.CS
            import Py_FS.wrapper.nature_inspired.EO
            import Py_FS.wrapper.nature_inspired.GA
            import Py_FS.wrapper.nature_inspired.GSA
            import Py_FS.wrapper.nature_inspired.GWO
            import Py_FS.wrapper.nature_inspired.HS
            import Py_FS.wrapper.nature_inspired.MA
            import Py_FS.wrapper.nature_inspired.PSO
            import Py_FS.wrapper.nature_inspired.RDA
            import Py_FS.wrapper.nature_inspired.SCA
            import Py_FS.wrapper.nature_inspired.WOA
        
        ## 2. Filter-based Feature Selection
        Filter methods do not use any intermediate learning algorithm to verify the strength of the generated solutions. Instead, they use statistical measures to identify the importance of different features in the context. So, finally every feature gets a rank according to their relevance in the dataset. The top features can then be used for classification. 
        
        Py_FS currently supports the following 4 filter-based FS methods:
        * Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC)
        * Spearman Correlation Coefficient (SCC)
        * Relief
        * Mutual Information (MI)
        
        These filter approaches can be imported in your code using the following statements:
            
            import Py_FS.filter.PCC
            import Py_FS.filter.SCC
            import Py_FS.filter.Relief
            import Py_FS.filter.MI
        
        ## 3. Evaluation Metrics
        The package comes with tools to evaluate features before or after FS. This helps to easily compare and analyze 
        performances of different FS procedures. 
        
        Py_FS currently supports the following evaluation metrics:
        * classification accuracy
        * average recall
        * average precision
        * average f1 score
        * confusion matrix
        * confusion graph
        
        The evaulation capabilities can be imported in your code using the following statement:
            
            from Py_FS.evaulation import evaluate
